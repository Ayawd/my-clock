            <p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey.[3] They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish.</p>
           
            <p>On 26 September 2019, Global Citizen announced that Coldplay would perform at Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream on 26 September 2020.[185] On 18 October 2019, mysterious black-and-white posters began appearing in various countries around the world, with the band in vintage-style clothing and a date showing 22 November 1919. The band also changed their profile pictures on social media to a sun and moon, making fans speculate an imminent release of new material.[186] On 19 October 2019, a cryptic 5 second teaser was released on social media with orchestral music in the background.[187] On 21 October 2019, in a letter sent to fans, the band announced that their eighth studio album would be titled Everyday Life[188] and that it would be a double album, with the first half titled Sunrise and the second half titled Sunset.</p>
